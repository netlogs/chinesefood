## The Origins of Peking Duck

The origins of Peking Duck can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) in Beijing. It was during this time that the dish became a staple in the imperial courts, with chefs perfecting the technique of slow-roasting duck over fragrant hardwood fires. 

The dish gained widespread popularity during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) when it became a must-try for foreign dignitaries visiting the Forbidden City. Today, Peking Duck remains strongly associated with the culture and culinary heritage of Beijing.
