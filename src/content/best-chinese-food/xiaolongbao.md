# Xiaolongbao (小笼包 - Xiǎo Lóng Bāo): Shanghai's Soup Dumpling Delicacy

## Introduction
Xiaolongbao, literally "little basket dumplings," are perhaps Shanghai's most celebrated contribution to Chinese cuisine. These delicate soup-filled dumplings represent the pinnacle of dumpling craftsmanship, where paper-thin wrappers delicately cradle a flavorful meat filling and rich, hot soup.

## Historical Origins

Originally from Changzhou (常州), a city near Shanghai, Xiaolongbao emerged in the 1870s and was popularized by the now-famous Nanxiang Mantou Shop (南翔馒头店) in Shanghai's Yu Garden. The name comes from the small bamboo baskets (小笼 - xiǎo lóng) used to steam these dumplings.
